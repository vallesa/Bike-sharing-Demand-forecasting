# Bike-sharing-Demand-forecasting
Through this project we aim to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. on any given day using R studio. Furthemore, Given the daily bike demand for 2011 and 2012, we will forecast  the 2013 bike demand through an univariate time series analysis using a seasonality factor in SAS.

The other 2 documents are the R file and the SAS code in a word docuement.
